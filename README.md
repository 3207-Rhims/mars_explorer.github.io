# mars_explorer.github.io
Mainly this project actually gives you a Mars exploring feeling. Here's a game prototype which games you to imagine how mars life will be. You can build Mars on your own. Also, I have a website about this, where you can play these games, and here you can see everyday curiosity capture picture and by date and also you can vote for the picture of the day and for a picture of the month. You can explore everyday Mars using this site. Also Here you can write and read science fiction and research about Mars. 
And that's how we can enrich peoples interest in space science.
